/*High Low Game!

Welcome to the world of game development!

You are going to build a game using the CLI.

The specs for the game are:
- game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- prompts user to guess the number
- if user's guess is less than the number, it outputs "HIGHER"
- if user's guess is more than the number, it outputs "LOWER"
- if a user guesses the number, the game should declare "GOOD GUESS!"

Hints:
- Using conditionals and loops here is important
- Random numbers can be made with the internal rand() function
- If user is right, tell them they won
- While they are wrong, give them hints and keep asking
- Use exit(0) to end the game
- If you get stuck in game, ctrl-c will exit.*/
